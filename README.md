Coming soon

This whole thing is not complete yet, for instance, the metadata db isn't persistent. Most of the existing stuff need polishing too e.g. incomplete tests, missing comment on exported functions and vars, custom metrics, etc

The client part is a bit messy. It is obvious that it can be cleaned up and simplified now that it's partly implemented. 

This README will document design decisions, trade-offs, future enhancements, and the architectural evolution required for production readiness.

Todo:
1. Document the design, etc (update this readme)
2. Add more tests
3. Complete the implementation 
4. Clean up the code
